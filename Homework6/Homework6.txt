Homework:

-- Remove ID from customer addition, modify ALL tables 
to auto increment id (do not change anything)



-- Controller for placing order: this will not be your standard CRUD API, it will contain: placeOrder(orderId, orderDetails):  add new order details
to order, will fail if orderId does not already exist,
 also updated product stock placeOrder(order, orderDetails)‚Äù: add new order and order details, will
fail if orderId already exists placeOrder methods should make their checks and call product stock updates
in the business logic layer (separate package and annotate with @Service)


-- Controller for payments
	registerPayment(payment): add payment to database
